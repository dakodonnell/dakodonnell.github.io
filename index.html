        <p>I once thought that encounters with others left imprints, big or small, connecting lives as a needle pierces two fabrics, thread in tow, forming the counterparts of a quilt. I could see these threads form and unravel, like the swell of the sea, ebbing and flowing onward and out. I could see these threads plainy, not by their form but by what they formed. I could see these threads, and they could see me.</p>
        <p>Our fabrics are not us, they are ours. They belong to the common thread.</p>
        <p>When one becomes aware of this, it's possible to see life in a new light. Meeting strangers feels like seeing old friends. With a trained eye, nothing is unfamiliar, nothing is new. Commonalities shared by loved ones, enemies, strangers, it's all there for one to notice.</p>
        <p>The self is simply the limitation imposed by your perception, but what lies beyond the fringes of sight are continuations.</p>
        <p>
